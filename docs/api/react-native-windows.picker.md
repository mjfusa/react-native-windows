## Picker class

Picker is a controlled component, which expects the selectedValue prop to be updated whenever selection changes, or selection will revert to the prop selectedValue

when using editable=true, onValueChange can be called with a selectedValue of null &amp; Index of -1, and text will be provided. To maintain the text in the controlled component, props should reflect that state by specifying selectedValue of null and specify the text property.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class Picker extends React.Component<IPickerProps, State> 
```
<b>Extends:</b> React.Component&lt;IPickerProps, State&gt;
